			<!-- Challenge & Goal Section -->
	    <div>
	      <h4 class="highlight-subtitle"> The Challenge & Goal</h4>
	      <p> Sharing a common space is a practice of communication and compromise. Whether you are roommates or family members living in the same house, constant communication and coordination is necessary to reduce conflict. We wanted to create an app that allows multiple people in a household to create and view chores and tasks that need to be done at a single destination.</p>
				<p></p>

			<!-- Needfinding -->
			<div>
				<h4 class="highlight-subtitle">User Research</h4>
				<p>I conducted user research to help narrow the scope and functionality of the application that was invisioned. We interviewed people from potential user groups and asked about how they interact with their roommates and apartmentmates. The answers to the interview questions allowed me to gain insights about and empathize with who I was designing.
				</p>
				<p>Some crucial insights I gained from observing and interviewing potential users were:
					<br>
					<div class="interview-resp">
						<ul>
							<li>One of the reasons why living with other people is difficult is because of a lack of communication.</li>
							<li>Even when an agreement is in place, it is usually forgotten about.</li>
							<li>People are busy, they forget, or just might not realize that it was their turn to do a chore.</li>
							<li>Confrontation is difficult. Burying problems that you have with someone else can lead to bigger issues that never get addressed.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

			<!-- Paper Prototyping -->
			<div>
				<h4 class="highlight-subtitle"> Paper Prototyping</h4>
				<p> In order to test our idea and the work flow of the app, we created paper prototypes. Each screen, dropdown menu, and pop-up screen was drawn out on paper with a Sharpie and tested with people from our intended user group.
				</p>

			<!-- Web Developmemt -->
			<div>
				<h4 class="highlight-subtitle" style="text-align: left">Web Development & High-Fidelity Prototyping</h4>
				<p> In my team, I had the most experience with HTML, CSS, and JS, so I took on the lead developer role. Utilizing Node.js for app development, I coded in HTML, CSS, and JS for the app skeleton and styling.
				</p>

			<!-- A/B Testing -->
			<div>
				<h4 class="highlight-subtitle">A/B Testing</h4>
				<p>One of the major motivations for this app was not only to create a shared chore board, but to also make it location based. A location-centric organization method provides a spatial method of reminding users about what needs to be done around the house. As a result, we A/B tested the usage of words of locations versus the usage of vector art representaions of locations. Version A (word descriptions) is on the left, and Version B (icon descriptions) is on the right.
				</p>
				<br>
				<div>
					<img src="./images/projects/choreboard/abVersions.png" class="project-img">
				</div>
				<p><b>Results: </b>The A/B experiment was performed for 27 individuals; 15 for version A, and 12 for version B. At 86.67%, Version A had a 3.85% higher conversion rate than version B.</p>
				<p><b>Analysis:  </b>From our results, we hypothesized why version A received a higher conversion rate than version B.</p>
				<div class="interview-resp">
					<ol>
						<li>It could have been easier for users to understand what each button represented when they read the word instead of needing to deduce what an icon represented.</li>
						<li>The different color scheme could have been offputting to users. Since version B had a separate color scheme, it may have added to their confusion and prompted them to click the "View All" button that they immediately understood.</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
				<p><b>Takeaways:  </b>While we ultimately decided to proceed with version A with just word descriptions of the locations, we thought that the icons matched our intended goal more. Something we hadn't thought of before A/B testing was combining it and having both an icon and the word of the location. A/B testing was a great learning experience for me because users always do things unexpectedly, and that results must always be taken with a grain of salt. </p>

			<!-- Final Prototype -->
			<div>
				<h4 class="highlight-subtitle">Final Prototype</h4>
				<p>After extensive analysis, ideation, and high fidelity prototypes the final prototype addresses the user need we had identified in the beginning. It allows users who live together to access a shared list of tasks and fosters communication and accountability between people.
