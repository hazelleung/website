  			   <h4 class="highlight-subtitle">Opportunity</h4>
            </div>
  			   <p>Music apps are used to create playlists, add/delete songs from playlists, organize songs, and discover new songs. However, as new songs are discovered and are favored and older songs are fallen out of favor, they become repeatedly skipped and/or overlooked when creating a new playlist. From Spotify to Apple Music, music apps are focused on an individual person's music experience. This creates an opportunity for a music app that is more social and based on collaboration. <span>How might we enable a user to more easily create new playlists, add or delete songs from a playlist, and manage their playlists?</span></p>

            </div>
                <p><b> User Interviews:</b>
                <br>
  				Several people from different demographical spaces were interviewed in order to contextualize when, why, and how music apps are used. The interviewees ranged from ages 18-25, and they were all people who regularly listened to music on their phone. I phrased the interview questions in a non-leading in order to prevent bias and in a way that helps users frame their state of mind as they use current music apps.</p>
                
                <p>Example interview questions:</p>
				<div class="interview-resp">
                    <ul>
				        <li>Which music apps do you use? Which one do you use the most?</li>
				        <li>When do you normally use this music app?</li>
                        <li>How much time do you spend managing your playlists?</li>
                        <li>What do you currently like about how this music app allows you to manage your music?</li>
                        <li>What do you currently dislike about how this music app allows you to manage your music?</li>
                        <li>How do you discover new music?</li>
                        <li>Can you walk me through how you would create a new playlist?</li>
                    </ul>
				</div>
                <p>The results of the interviews were used to create distinct scenarios that helped frame specific ways a music app is potentially used to play music, to manage songs/playlists, and to perform social media functions. These scenarios were divided into functions that are frequently used and functions that are more specific to a particular user.</p>
                
                <p>Example Scenarios:</p>
                <div class="interview-resp">
                    <ul>
				        <li>Creating a collaborative playlist with friends.</li>
                        <li>Adding new songs to an existing playlist dedicated to songs a user currently enjoys.</li>
                        <li>Deleting songs from a playlist because they are continuously skipped.</li>
                        <li>Reording the songs in a playlist.</li>
                        <li>Following friends to see what music/songs they are listening to.</li>
				    </ul>

			<!-- Selecting User Goals -->
			<div class= "bottom-highlight2">
				<h4 class="highlight-subtitle">Narrowing Down the User Goals</h4>
            </div>
				<p> This project was done for a class focusing on usability and information architecture. Thus, instead of creating an entire app, we were required to choose specific user scenarios and redesign a music app that improves the usability of a specific function within the music app. We based these user goals off of the user interviews we conducted.</p>
				<p>First, <span>we decided to create a music app that integrated both social aspects and music playing capabilities.</span> An app that emphasizes the social aspect of music allows users to interact with their friends and discover new music. In our interviews, many people noted that they liked how current popular music apps effectively promoted new music. At the same time, interviewees told us that they found their music app to be a relatively solitary experience, and would like to know what their friends were listening to.</p>
				<p>Our second scenario is more general and is a function that is used in any and every music app. Finding a way to easily delete a song from a playlist is important because many users continuously update the songs that they have in their playlists. This requires deleting existing songs in a playlist to make room for a new song to be added. We chose this usability scenario because the steps to deleting a song from a playlist varies greatly from application to application, and we wanted to explore whether there is a more effective way to delete songs.</p>

            <!-- Competitive Analysis -->
  		    <div class= "bottom-highlight2">
                <h4 class="highlight-subtitle"> Competitive Analysis </h4>
            </div>
                <p> I compared and contrasted existing music apps to analyze different work flows and pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of certain design choices. We analyzed design choices for clarity, for ease of use, and for facilitation of user control. Below are example workflows of creating and managing playlists using Spotify and Google Play Music.</p>
                
                <p><b>Spotify:</b></p>

                <img src="./images/projects/musicApp/compAnalysisGoogle.png" class="project-img animated fadeIn">

                <div class="row" style="margin:0">
                    <div class="col-sm-6">
                        <p> <b>Spotify:</b>
							<!--Spotify has a relatively easy workflow to create a playlist, however it did not have an intuitive way to create a collaborative playlist. In order to create any playlist, a user has to select "Edit" in the top right corner to manage the playlists. There is then an option to create a new playlist. After naming the new playlist, a user is brought to a page to add music to the newly created playlist. There are several more additional steps in order to make the playlist collaborative and is not an option in the normal pathway of creating a playlist. </p>
							<p> Deleteing a song from a playlist was intuitive and easy to navigate. They select a button in the top right corner indicating playlist options and then the "edit" option to edit the playlist. This brings the user to a page where they can delete any songs from the playlist by tapping on a minus sign.-->
							Spotify had a very complex workflow that frustrated a lot of users. For example, in order to delete a song from a playlist, they had to click on the playlist's settings icon, then another edit icon, and then they can finally delete the song form the playlist. Many Spotify functions would route the user through the playlist settings, adding additional steps that contributed to a lack of efficiency.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-6">
                        <p> <b>Google Play Music:</b>
							Google Play Music is an example of a less effective workflow. In order to create a playlist, a user has to find a specific song first that they want to add to a playlist. <!--They then have to select the song options and then add that song to a playlist. Only then can a user create a new playlist to add the song to. This is difficult to use because there is no option to create a playlist from the main playlist page, where a user would generally expect to find an option to create and delete playlists from.--> This is a long and painstaking process to add many songs to a new playlist. However, Google Play Music's design for deleting a song is intuitive. <!--A user just has to swipe to the left on the song they want to delete. -->When a user swipes left, it reveals a button that allows a user to delete the song from the playlist.</p>

            </div>
  			   <p> For the initial design of the prototype, I made sure to include the ‘news feed’ on the Homepage of the app. Since this app is intended to be used socially, I decided to use a blue color scheme. Many social media platforms use blue. However, this design was was very functional. There wasn't much aesthetic considered in the layout and the screen ended up relatively cramped. Therefore, I decided to redesign the pages. I rethought the color scheme and reimagined the app layout.</p>

				<h4 class="highlight-subtitle"> Iteration & Final Design</h4>
            </div>
                <p>The redesign address many of the initial problems I found in the first design. I spaced spaced objects further apart, maintained a consistent margin throughout the different pages, and I made button functionality clearer.</p>
                <p>The final prototype reflects the user research, analysis, and ideation that we performed. It addressed the main pain points that users found in apps like Spotify and Google Music. By making the homepage a feed of friend activity and by supporting collaborative playlists, this app makes music more fun!</p>
