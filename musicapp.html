In order to create any playlist, a user has to select "Edit" in the top right corner to manage the playlists. There is then an option to create a new playlist. After naming the new playlist, a user is brought to a page to add music to the newly created playlist. There are several more additional steps in order to make the playlist collaborative and is not an option in the normal pathway of creating a playlist. </p>
							<p> Deleteing a song from a playlist was intuitive and easy to navigate. They select a button in the top right corner indicating playlist options and then the "edit" option to edit the playlist. This brings the user to a page where they can delete any songs from the playlist by tapping on a minus sign.-->
							Spotify had a very complex workflow that frustrated a lot of users. For example, in order to delete a song from a playlist, they had to click on the playlist's settings icon, then another edit icon, and then they can finally delete the song form the playlist. Many Spotify functions would route the user through the playlist settings, adding additional steps that contributed to a lack of efficiency.</p>

Only then can a user create a new playlist to add the song to. This is difficult to use because there is no option to create a playlist from the main playlist page, where a user would generally expect to find an option to create and delete playlists from.--> This is a long and painstaking process to add many songs to a new playlist. However, deleting a song is intuitive. <!--A user just has to swipe to the left on the song they want to delete. -->When a user swipes left, it reveals a button that allows a user to delete the song from the playlist.</p>

  			   <p>For the initial design of the prototype, we made sure to include the ‘news feed’ on the Homepage of the app. Since this app is intended to be used socially, we decided to use a blue color scheme. Many social media platforms use blue. However, this design was was very utilitarian, and did not reflect the branding that we initially envisioned.</p>

            </div>
            <p> There wasn't much aesthetic considered in the layout and the screen ended up relatively cramped. Therefore, we decided to redesign the pages. I rethought the color scheme and reimagined the app layout. The redesign address many of the initial problems I found in the first design. I spaced spaced objects further apart, maintained a consistent margin throughout the different pages, and I made button functionality clearer.</p>

            <p> I loved revisiting the design and improving upon it. I think that originally, the visual side of the update was something we had deprioritized because we were rushing to finish by a deadline. But, the visual component is just as important as the research and interaction side of the design. <span>Together, the user research, experience, and visual components are what makes a design great.</span></p>
            <p>I would have liked to conduct more research than just user interviews. While user interviews are great at digging into major pain points and bringing depth to a problem space, it does not have much generalizability since the sample size was small. I think <span>by doing more research through methods like surveys and early prototyping would have made our solution more effective.</span></p>
