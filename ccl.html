      <div>
        <h4 class="highlight-subtitle"> The Challenge & Goal</h4>
        <p>As a new lab to UCSD, there was an opportunity to design and create a website. I wanted to design a website that was professional, clean, and had all the information that parents. CCL is a lab that studies how children reason about social norms, so the website needeed to be able to access any information about the lab, how to contact the lab, and directions to the lab. At the same time, undergraduate and graduate students needed to be able to access information about joining the lab as a research assistant, graduate student, or as a post-doctoral researcher. </p>

      <!-- Competitive Analysis -->
			<div>
        <h4 class="highlight-subtitle"> Competitive Analysis </h4>
        <p> In order to get a sense of what and how to design for a lab website, I looked at other UCSD lab websites. I found that most lab websites have sections about what the lab studies, lab team pages, pages for undergraduate students, pages for graduate students, and pages for parents. I tried to focus on cognitive psychology lab websites because they most closely aligned to the Comparative Cognition Lab research topics.

              </p>
              <p><b>Red box/People tab:</b> All four websites has a page that lists (and gives information about) the people who are currently involved in the lab. This includes the Principal Investigator, post-doctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students.</p>
              <p><b>Green box/Publication tab:</b> All four websites has a page that lists all the recent scientific publications published by the lab/in collaboration with the lab.</p>
              <p><b>Orange Box/Join the Lab tab:</b> Three of the four websites has a tab that leads to a page and gives information about joining the lab. This is a resource for undergraduate students wanting to become a research assistant, graduate students wanting an advisor, or post-doctoral researchers who are interested in the type of research done by the lab.</p>
              <p><b>Yellow Box/Information for Parents:</b> Since the top two labs conducts studies with children, there is a specific tab for parents to find information about what the lab is about and how they can participate. This is <i>especially</i> relevant for the CCL website because it is also a lab that does studies with children.</p>

      <!-- Wireframe Section -->
			<div>
        <h4 class="highlight-subtitle"> Wireframing</h4>
        <p> I created a series of wireframing sketches in order to visualize the workflow and general layout of different pages a user would interact with. Most of the navigation is designed to be within the website at the main navigation bar that would be pinned at the top of the page. There are some links that lead to external websites (links to the official UCSD Cognitive Science page, links to the affiliated organization's website, etc.). These sketches helped me visualize the website layout and make some design choices before implementation.

      <!-- Drawback  -->
			<div>
        <h4 class="highlight-subtitle"> Constraints & Drawbacks</h4>
        <p> When I went to implement the design, the lab was told that we had to use Wordpress to host the website. Additionally, we were also told that the Cognitive Science department also use a specific layout. This meant that a lot of the design choices I had made were now infeasible. For example, I was unable to create the home page buttons that leads a user to learn more about the lab, to participate in the lab studies, or to information about joining the lab. Another example is that I was uable to add the lab affiliations/organiation collaborations at the bottom of the home page. Another big change was the footer at the bottom of each page -- it disappeared comopletely in the implemented design.

      <!-- Final Design Section -->
			<div>
        <h4 class="highlight-subtitle">Current Design</h4>
        <p>I wanted to use a selection of photos that represented the types of research the lab does because it was a simple way to create lab-specific identity. Therefore, I used a mix of images on the home page that showcased humans, non-human primates, and other animals. This iteration of the website has some components that I wish were different, but are impossible to change due to the limitations of a specific theme. I am currently implementing some design changes through HTML and CSS customization.</p>
        <p>Despite some design changes that are in the process of being applied, the information architecture and workflow of the website has been completed. Click the link below to see the full website!</p>
