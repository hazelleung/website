                <p> The Equilibrium is a relatively new organization, and because of this, branding and design has been inconsistent and experimental. For this issue, we wanted to make the journal more professional, coherent, and consistent. Since The Equilibrium is an interdisciplinary research journal, a particular challenge was presented: How do we create an effective page layout that clearly showcases, represents, and supports all types of research, regardless of the research field.</p>

            <!-- User Research section -->

                <h4 class="highlight-subtitle"> User Research </h4>
                <p><b> User Interviews:</b></p>
                <br>
                
                <p>In order to gauge what features users enjoyed or were confused by, user interviews were conducted. Questions were asked to evaluate the effectiveness of a design choice. Questions included, but were not limited to: "What is your initial response to the journal?" "Were there moments/pages where you found it hard to read/understand?" "What is one aspect that you would improve?"</p>
                <p>I used these interviews to frame and contextualize the design choices for the new issue of the journal. From the interviews, I gathered that a major challege was creating a uniform presentation, especially within the a single journal issue itself. Major points were to standardize the page frames, color used, and page layouts for easier readability.</p>
                
                <p>Example Responses:</p>
                <br>
                    
                <div class="interview-resp">
                     <p>"Issue 1 doesn't have consistency like Issue 2. Some sections have a (too) bold red border, others have starry night backgrounds, one has only blue tables, and another has red triangle geographic patterns. It makes it confusing to know what I'm reading when just paging through the journal."</p>
                    <p>"I really love the color scheme and font colors on the 'Professor Spotlight' section - the consistent color of the professor name and questions makes it super easy to both find the page I'm interested in and find the question I'm interested in having answered."</p>
                    <p>"Flipping through the pages, I didn't like how there wasn't any consistency among sections (I think most major publications have a similar style/theme for "Professor Spotlight" vs. "Student Research" (like having all Professor Spotlights be bordered by red, and Student Research bordered by blue) and having that consistent among volumes."</p>

                <p> To create a professional journal layout, I looked at current scientific journal layout designs.</p>

                        <br>
                        Both samples had large article titles and large author names that were placed under the title. They were highlighted by either larger font and/or bolded for emphasis. Additionally, the abstract is highlighted to draw attention to it (i.e. a different colored bakground or lines bordering it). Lastly, the article itself has justified text.</p>

                        <br>
                        However, there are several differences in the layouts. One journal uses a one column layout while the other uses a two column layout. One journal uses serif font while the other uses sans-serif font. One journal has a prominent journal name while the other does not.</p>

                <h4 class="highlight-subtitle">Analysis of Previous Journal Issues</h4>
                <p> In order to improve the journal, I analyzed the previous two issues to understand what design choices were effective nad what design choices were not. From the user interviews, I had pinpointed the areas of improvement for the journal, so I focused on those issues first. We wanted to improve the branding of journals, create a more consistent layout within sections of the journal, and get rid of experimental styling.</p>

                <!-- Branding Prev Journal Analysis -->
                <p><b>1. Branding</b>
                <br>
                Below are the covers of the first two issues. I decided to tackle the branding challenge with the cover of the journal issue because the cover is the first thing that people see. Creating a consistent layout and cover will allow users to immediately see that the journal is The Equilibrium without really reading it. Below are the covers of the first two editions. There were some key features that I wanted to continue with volume three, and there were some differences that was going to change.</p>

                            Both covers had a large journal title at the top of the page. Both covers had the volume number on the bottom side of the page. Additionally, both issues had the journal logo at the bottom right corner of the page.</p>

                            There were also inconsistencies between the two covers: "Equilibrium" vs. "The Equilibrium," "Warren Undergraduate Research Journal" vs. "Warren College Undergraduate Research Journal," issue theme listed or not, and issue seasonal date.</p>

            <h4 class="highlight-subtitle"> Prototyping</h4>
            <p> Several iterations of a page were done over the course of a month. Below are examples of a couple of iterations that I created. I based these designs off of the reader interviews, the analysis of previous issues, and the competitive analysis I had done.</p>
            <p> Because the journal is interdisciplinary, I had to adapt page designs to suit different types of research. For example, the 2017 issue contains research from the engineering, economics, and visual arts research pages.
        </div>

        <p> <b>Base Resarch Layouts:</b>
        <br>
        These two iterations have different characterisitcs, but also have similar characteristics that were based on the competitive analysis that was previously done.</p>

            <p style="padding-bottom: 1%"> After several iterations, I selected design choices that communicated a professional, clean research journal. At the same time, I wanted to create a layout that was accessible to a wide range of possible readers. </p>
            <br>
            
            <b>Hardest decision:</b>
            <p>Finding a clean design that was versatile and able to accomodate different types of research was particularly challenging and interesting. Since some research submissions are more visual based (photos, graphs, and tables), the layout had to be able to include essential figures while also be adaptable to those that did not have many figures. Choosing the two column format allowed images to be interspersed within the text and provided visual detail that preemptively prevents articles from becoming large blocks of text.
