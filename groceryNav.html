  			   <p>Grocery stores are the primary shopping locations for shoppers of all ages. Most grocery stores do not have directories or maps so customers have to wander through the aisles or ask an employee to find a items. This can be frustrating when shoppers want to find an item quickly, especially if they do not want to talk with a employee. How can we help grocery shoppers navigate the store more efficiently? </p>

                <p><b>Field Observations:</b>
                <br>
  				We targeted three types of stores (traditional grocery store, specialty store, and bulk stores) at different times of the day and on different days of the week. This was done to provide a wide range of combinations that could possibly yield different shopper observations.</p>
                <p>Sample Observations:</p>
				<div class="interview-resp">
                    <ul>
				        <li>In traditional grocery stores and specialty stores, people tend to congregate around the periphery of the store </li>
				        <li>Aisles are generally relatively empty </li>
                        <li>Shopper demographics changes depending on the time of day and the day of the week</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p><b>Interviews:</b>
                <br>
  				There were a several rounds of interview questions that we asked. As we were narrowing down our problem scope, we asked more specific questions about grocery store navigation.</p>
                
                <p>Example interview questions:</p>
				<div class="interview-resp">
                    <ul>
				        <li>How often do you go grocery shopping?</li>
				        <li>When do you usually go grocery shopping?</li>
                        <li>Why do you normally go at this time?</li>
                        <li>Do you ever encounter any annoyances/problems when shopping?</li>
                        <li>How do you navigate the store?</li>
                    </ul>
				</div>

                <p><b>Survey:</b>
                <br>
  				We created a grocery shopping experience survey that was aimed to explore people's’ grocery shopping behavior. We received 82 responses by distributing the survey to friends, family, and co-workers. While we attempted to reach a wide demographic, we did receive mostly student responses (over 50%). Overall, the survey data that we gathered was effective in helping us understand our stakeholders more. However, the data we gathered was really only on one type of stakeholder: undergraduate students. So, we conducted interviews as well.</p>

				    <h4 class="highlight-subtitle">Defining The Problem Space</h4>
                </div>
				<p> Originally, our design problem was about expiration dates and food labels. However, when we conducted field interviews and field observations, and received responses to our google survey, we realized that what we thought was a problem was not actually one. We were looking through our data points on our affinity diagram to find evidence to support our original design problem, but found it lacking. <span>Designing with a bottom-up process is essential -- you need to do the research to make sure you're actually addressing a real problem!</span></p>

                </div>
                
                <p>As a result, we pivoted, recreated our affinity diagram, and found an overlying problem. Overall, we saw that there were concerns about time. People plan their shopping trip time around when they were available to go (e.g. after work, after school, before picking someone up). People also plan their trips before going in order to make their trip as fast as possible (e.g. they make a physical grocery list, they use Google Keep to store their notes, etc.). There are also roadblocks that occur when shoppers go on their grocery trip that frustrate them. Interviewees noted that when there are a lot of people in the store, it is too crowded for them to efficiently navigate around the store. So, <b>how can we help grocery shoppers navigate the store more efficiently?</b></p>

                <p>We began exploring our ideas with storyboarding because it was an easy and cheap method, and it helped us frame the contexts our solutions would be in.

Instead of the traditional aisle that spans from one end of the store to the other, we wanted to split the long aisle into smaller sections. This would, theoretically, allow for more specific categorizations in the aisle signs that would help shoppers in finding the exact items that they want. From our research, we found that people were frustrated with the spatial layout of aisles. From not being able to maneuver smoothly to being unable to roam through aisles, people wanted aisles to be more easily navigable. </p>

Jane’s local grocery store just renovated their store and so aisles have been moved around. We based this storyboard on paint points we found from our google form survey and our field interviews. She has difficulty finding items and wanted to get in and out. Our solution is to have color coded lines on the floor to help Jane find items in the store. Many of our interviewees talked about having difficulty locating items in their grocery stores.</p>

Because grocery stores, even chain ones, tend to be set up in different layouts, it may be difficult for grocery shoppers to orient themselves in a new store they have never been too.  Using the lines, John is able to navigate through the store and find his items. We based this storyboard on the data points where people said that they were new to the area and therefore don’t know where items are placed. The lines on the ground would be specifically be beneficial to people who are new and/or unfamiliar with the grocery store.</p>

They don’t really understand how much to buy for how long so most of the time they end buying too much groceries. It’s easy to overestimate how much groceries they need. This causes great loss in money and also food waste that could have been prevented with a planned out grocery shopping list. One design solution can be having a grocery shopping list provided by grocery stores that breaks down necessities and categories the necessary products. By being able to plan their grocery shopping list visually, there should be less food waste and lead to a smarter way of spending. </p>

                <p> We then proceeded to paper prototyping. Since we were unable get permission to prototype our solutions in a real grocery store, we decided to create a faux grocery store in a classroom. We created directory maps to plan how we would set up the room to mimic a real grocery store. Important/popular sections of a store were used in the store simulation: produce, frozen food, meat, dairy, packaged foods, and beverages. These sections were represented by printout images of items that would be found in their respective sections. We then proceeded to create maps of the lines on the ground directory.</p>

However, we realized that if a shopper were actually using the lines, they would be successfully brought to the first section, but there would not be any line at that section to direct them to another. For example, if someone went to the produce section and then wanted to get to the frozen food section, they would not know how to get there because there would not be any frozen food line in the produce section. </p>

We were having difficulties finding a way to connect all the lines to all of the directories. Lines converge and become a web at the entrance and near the meats section.</p>

These were placed perpendicular to the entrance wall. Each aisle was comprised of 3 tables that were placed next to each other. Chairs were used to represent the shopping carts.

                        <li>We applied the feedback we got from the validation interviews to the next iteration for our prototype. In the first round, none of the participants noticed the wall directories or the lines on the ground. In the second round, participants still had difficulty utilizing the prototype because they weren’t sure what the colors meant. In the third round, participants still had difficulties using our prototypes even through tehy understood how they worked. In the fourth round, all participants noted that the directories on the carts were very effective. </li>

				    <h4 class="highlight-subtitle"> Final Design</h4>
                </div>
				<p>For our final design solution, we would implement directory maps on the carts and four directory maps on the walls oriented in the perspective of the customer standing in the store at that location. The color coded lines on the ground were not an effective design solution because customers did not particularly use it, and it was confirmed in our validation interviews. Even after implementing the labels on the lines in our third iteration, a participant mentioned how it was confusing because it was maze-like. </p>
                <p>The most essential part of this solution are the cart maps, because as seen through our final round of testing, this was the most used and most useful mode of assistance. During every round of testing, participants found it useful to orient themselves from the front of the store with the cart map. It was particularly convenient because these maps were attached to the carts, it could be with them throughout their entire shopping experience.</p>
                <p>The directories in the store were also referenced by some individuals. Although they were not as referenced by customers as the cart directories, some shoppers may not use carts, so we kept it in our design solution to allow those who don’t use carts access to the directory. We decided to orient the wall directories according to the view of the grocery shopper standing in the store at that location. This design comes from the suggestion from the validation interview in our second iteration where many were confused by the wall directories all being the same orientation (the orientation from the front of the store). </p>
