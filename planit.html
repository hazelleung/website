            <h4 class="highlight-subtitle"> The Challenge & Goal</h4>
            <p>Planning trips and vacations is very time-consuimg and requires a lot of coordination. When planning a trip, people need to take budget, time, location, and group size constraints into account, and this is often a multi-tab or multi-browser window task. We wanted to design a platform that improves the travel planning experience by streamlining and automating the process of discovering activities to do. Since this was a startup project, the business aspect and viability were taken into consideration when designing solutions.</p>

        <!-- User Research section -->

            <h4 class="highlight-subtitle"> User Research </h4>
            <p>
                <b> Surveys:</b>
                <br>
                A survey was sent out to different stakeholder groups to understand their mindset before and during travel. I designed the survey to grasp traveler behavior, to find pain points, and to identify needs and wants. The results were then analyzed to construct a framework for our design process and app development.</p>
                
                <div class="row">
                    <img src="./images/projects/planit/graphsPlanIt.png" class="project-img">

                <b> User Interviews:</b>
                <br>
                Surveys can't tell a whole story, so we conducted user interviews of different user groups to gain a deeper understanding into the problem space we were addressing.</p>
                <div class="interview-resp">
                    <ul>
                        <li>The biggest factors travelers consider when planning a trip were money and quality. They wanted the highest quality trip with the cheapest option.</li>
                        <li>People hate hard to find and/or inaccurate information. They don't want to spend time looking up informtion that should be readily available to a potential visitor (operation hours, price, location, etc.)</li>
                        <li>When traveling for leisure, people want the freedom to plan and organize activities the way they want. Vacation should not be stressful!</li>
                    </ul>

        <!-- Ideation -->
        <div>
            <h4 class="highlight-subtitle"> Ideation</h4>
            <p>There were several pain points that we identified from our research, so we ideated several different design solutions that could tackle different problems. Each solution was meant to undertake the different kinds of concerns a traveler may have when planning or going on vacation. </p>
            
            <div class="row">
                <img src="./images/projects/planit/ideationPlanIt.png" class="project-img">
            </div>
            
            <p>We identified several needs of two user groups: those who travel for leisure and those who travel for business. We then used two questions to help frame app ideation. How might we maximize travel experience (in terms of time, money, location, etc.) for those with limited resources? How might we increase the comfort level between a traveler and their environment?</p>
            <p>Some possible solutions we came up with:</p>
                <div class="interview-resp">
                    <ul>
                        <li>A hedgefund housing program. Travelers agree to swap houses/house the other person at an agreed upon time. For example, person A houses person B when B visits. Two weeks later, person B houses person A.</li>
                        <li>An app that helps generate activities to do based on a person's available time and budget. It is meant to fill up gaps of time between larger/reserved activities.</li>
                        <li>Travelers' insurance. Before their trip, travelers purchase insurance as a safety net against emergencies/theft/accidents for peace of mind.</li>
                        <li>Ticket buying app. It's a one-stop shop for buying and reserving tickets to attractions. This saves time because travelers will not have to visit individual pages and can avoid scams.</li>
                        <li>A tour guide + travel aide person. This person would help a traveler navigate the location, suggest things to do, and provide general assistance as needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
        </div>
          
        <hr>
        
        <div>
            <h4 class="highlight-subtitle"> Final Idea</h4>
            <p>In the end, we decided to proceed with an application that helps users save time during the planning stage of a trip. </p>
            <p>The traveler inputs their travel information and the application generates activities that fit within the travelers' constraints. They can then review the displayed activities and either keep or shuffle to display other activities. </p>
            <p>As a traveler selects and locks in activities to keep, the cost of the activities are accounted for and refelected in the remaining budget. After the user's remaining budget cannot cover other activities or if they are out of available time, the user can then see available package deals or discounts that their selected activities offer. </p>
            <p>They can then purchase necessary tickets that are subsequently sent. This helps reduce the number of hours it takes to plan an itinerary and helps users avoid ticket scams.</p>

        <!-- Branding -->
        <div>
            <h4 class="highlight-subtitle"> Branding</h4>
            <p> Traveling is exciting and fun, so we wanted to select a color scheme that reflected adventure, discovery, wanderlust, and exhilaration. We decided to go with a green and blue color palette because it represented the Earth and the different possible destinations a person can travel.</p>
            
            <div class="row">
                <img src="./images/projects/planit/brandingPlanIt.png" class="project-img">

        <!-- Prototype -->
        <div>
            <h4 class="highlight-subtitle">Prototypes</h4>
            <p> The first prototype (left) was made with Balsamiq. It was lower fidelity and was used to test to concept and work flow of our application. The second prototype (right) was made with Sketch. It was higher fidelity and the app branding was better incorporated.</p>
            
            <div class="row">
                <img src="./images/projects/planit/prototypePlanIt.png" class="project-img">
            </div>
            
            <p>When creating the second prototype, I made some significant design changes:</p>
                <div class="interview-resp">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Made the remaining budget section larger than the rest of the traveling information to emphasize the application's budgeting function.</li>
                        <li>Incorporated branding elements. A large logo was placed on the top left as a navigation tool. A dark green banner was placed to frame the page. A light grey background was placed to distinguish between input form boxes and action buttons.</li>
                        <li>The "keep" button was changed to a "lock" button to depict that the attraction is locked in and will not change as a user shuffles for different attractions.</li>
                        <li>Pages were made a consistent size and objects were placed in the same place in every page.</li>
                    </ul>
